# _ShellB - "A better Shell than Shell"_

### So, How it works? 
So simple, is just a Shell with some "new features"

---

 ### What kind of "features"? (you say)...
 
 - For exemple, the "mkdir" now is "cf" {cf = create folder}

- The "rm" to remove folder, don't need additional args

### And this kind of stuff,  this project will be updated in some near future (maybe tomorrow)
